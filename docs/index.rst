Transmute AI Model Efficiency Toolkit (TrAILMET)
================================================
Transmute AI Model Efficiency Toolkit is an efficient and scalable library for making machine learning time, energy, cost, and compute efficient
built on top of pytorch.

**Background:** Trailmet is a model efficiency toolkit for compressing deep learning models using state of the art compression techniques.
Today deep learning models are not deployable because of their huge memory footprint, TRAILMET is an effort to make deep learning models more efficient in their size to performance ratio.
It is developed using Pytorch 1.13.

Major features
--------------
- State of the art compression algorithms implemented.
- Demo notebooks for training each algorithm.
- Modular Design: All alogithms are modular and can customized easily for any kind of model and dataset.
